## Features On The Way
I am applying for API keys for the following APIs, so that's why their development is slightly delayed.
- Checking if two users should go out together, using IBM Watson's analysis of the two users' messages, and thus deducing their personalities.
- Movie DB search and retrieval for movies and their ratings, actors, etc.,
- Spotify: Provides meta data on various songs.
- Google Knowledge Graph integration
- Basic moderation commands, including kicking users, detecting spam, etc.,

## Invite To Your Server (In case you didn't see above ^^)
[Just click here to invite Onyx to your server!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=444948120573313024&scope=bot&permissions=0)

## Run The Bot 
To run Onyx on your own server:

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Create a .env file at the root of the directory, and fill in the API keys and Discord IDs for the following:

```
TOKEN=
WOLFRAM_ALPHA_API_ID=
GIPHY_API_KEY=
IMGFLIP_PASS=
PIXABAY_API_KEY=
UNSPLASH_API_KEY=
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=
OWNER_DISCORD_ID=
LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID=
```

The LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID is the channel where you want your logs to go to. When the bot leaves or is added to a server, for example,
a message notifying you of this will be sent to the logging channel with the specified ID.

4. `npm start`

Make sure to **never** commit your `.env` file to version control, as your token and API keys will get leaked and your bot 
could become compromised. 

If the bot is setup successfully and the token is correct, you'll start to see logging appear in the console. ^^

If you want to test Onyx out before adding her to your server, [just join this server](https://discord.gg/cSWHaEK), and leave when you want.
